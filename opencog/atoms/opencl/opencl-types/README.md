OpenCL Atom Types
-----------------
This defines some atom types, currently, vector values, that can
move data to and from OpenCL kernels.

General information about the `opencl_types.script` file can be found
in the `opencog/atoms/atom_types` directory.

Experimental proof-of-concept prototype only.
