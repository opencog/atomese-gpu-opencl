Scaffolding and Examples
========================
This directory contains scaffolding and examples for running GPU code.

The examples should run on most(?) OpenCL hardware. However, they do
look for GPU's that have "AMD" in the name. Change as needed.

Notes and Resources
-------------------

Hardware support:
* https://www.x.org/wiki/RadeonFeature/
* https://www.amd.com/en/developer.html

Command line tools:
* `clinfo` to print OpenCL hardware
* `radeontop` to show GPU utilization

Hello-world examples from the inter-tubes:

* Hello-world OpenCL demo from 2019:
  https://github.com/cqcallaw/ocl-samples/

* Many different examples from 2017; all for Apple:
  https://github.com/rsnemmen/OpenCL-examples/
  including the most basic hello-world:
  https://github.com/rsnemmen/OpenCL-examples/blob/master/Hello_World/hello.c

* Tutorial from 2010, still seems mostly correct
  https://www.codeproject.com/articles/92788/introductory-tutorial-to-opencl

Overivew of OpenCL:
* https://www.khronos.org/opencl/resources
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCL

Languages:
* The OpenCL kernel language is based on C99, compiled by clang.
* Generic C++ for OpenCL, compiled by clang.
  https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCL-Guide/blob/main/chapters/cpp_for_opencl.md
* SYCL is based on c++17 "single source" can be compiled on various
  different compilers, incl. Inten DPC++, triSYCL and Codeplay ComputCpp

CUDA:
* Can run CUDA on OpenCL 1.2 using coriander
  https://github.com/hughperkins/coriander

* Can convert CUDA code to HIP code, which runs on amd and nvidia
  https://github.com/GPUOpen-ProfessionalCompute-Tools/HIP
  http://gpuopen.com/tag/hip/
  But this is now called ROCm ??

Non-obvious concepts:
* The kernel can be executed on a 1D, 2D, or 3D domain of indexes that
  execute in parallel.
* The total number of elements (aka indexes, aka work items) in the
  launch domain is called the global work size.
* Individual work-items can be grouped into work-groups, for inter-item
  communications. These are of "local work size".
